# Computer-Graphics

Computer Graphics is an introductory course for undergraduate students to introduce the basic concepts of computer graphics algorithms, software, and hardware. Here, we discuss different algorithms and mathematical procedures dealing with the representation and manipulation of graphical primitives and entities in the computer.

## Topics
1. OpenGL libraries in Python
2. (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm
3. Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm
4. Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm
5. 8-way Symmetry
